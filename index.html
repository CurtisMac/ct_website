      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Each woman’s birth experience is uniquely her own, it is intimate and personal. As a Doula it is a privilege to
      share in the birth process with a woman and her partner. I have had the joy of sharing the birth experience with several
      women and look forward to supporting many more strong, informed women who have thought through their wants and desires as
      they bring their precious babies to life. Recently I completed the Dona birth doula training at Mothering Touch in Victoria
      and continue to pursue my Doula certification through Dona International.
