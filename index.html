      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Each woman’s birth experience is uniquely her own, it is intimate and personal. As a Doula it is a privilege
        to share in the birth process with a woman and her partner. I have had the joy of sharing the birth experience
        with
        several women and look forward to supporting many more strong, informed women who have thought through their
        wants and
        desires as they bring their precious babies to life.</p>
      <p>Recently I completed the Dona birth doula training at Mothering
        Touch in Victoria and continue to pursue my Doula certification through Dona International.</p>
